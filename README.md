# 32-Bit_Single_Cycle_Core_RISC-V_Processor

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a 32-bit single-cycle RISC-V processor. The design is based on Digital Design and Computer Architecture, RISC-V Edition by David and Sarah Harris.

## Features
- Supports I-type, S-type, R-type, and B-type instructions
- Implements key operations:
  - Load (lw)
  - Store (sw)
  - Arithmetic and logical operations (R-type)
  - Branching (beq)
